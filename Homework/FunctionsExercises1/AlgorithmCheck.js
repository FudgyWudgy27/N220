/*
For the Drawing Drawer I'm not entirely sure what it is asking for me to do. 
I believe that it is asking for when a key is pressed, a part of the drawing appears. 
Once all parts appear, there should be atleast three copies of the drawing. 
Each copy should follow the mouse.
My plan is for there to be 4 copies and each one being a certain number of pixels away from the mouse at all time.\
I'll have to use the object function to group the shapes together.
Use a let object1 = mouseX/Y +/- ###.


For the Red Remover I believe that it is asking for me to write lines of code similar to what is given in the assignment.
This code will need to start with a predermined color and be able to remove an aspect of the rgb color code.

For the Polar Points I believe that it wants me to pull from the results of a sin/cosine function and to draw circles along it, without any circle overlapping.
