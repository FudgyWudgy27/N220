/*
My plan for this assignment is to create a main HTML page that will contain links to 3 other HTML pages. 
Each HTML page will consist of a different visual. 
The visuals will be "Ever larger, until not," "Ball Bounce," and "World Wrap." 

For the "Ever larger, until not," I will need to use an if() statement to determine when the circle reaches 200 pixels so that I can revert it back down to 1 pixel.
Depending on how the code works, I might need to add a for() statement to loop the process.

For the "Ball Bounce," I will need to use if() statements to check if the radius of the ball is touching the edge of the canvas. 
If the radius is touching it, then I need the ball to go a different direction.

For the "World Wrap," I will need to use an if() statement to determine if the radius of the ball has started to go outside of the right side of the canvas edge.
When it detects even a pixel of the radius, then I want it to create a new ball on the left side of the cavas edge.
Once the first ball gets off the screen, I want it to be deleted and for the second ball to have fully appeared on the left side.
My goal is to make it look like the ball is reappearing on the left side while it disappears on the right.
I might need a for() loop statement to do this.

If I have more time after these three are done, I will attempt to do the other two visuals also.
