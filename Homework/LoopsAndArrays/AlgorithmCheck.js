/*
For the Loop, but Big task I will need a variable that will start out at 1000.
I will need to write a loop that displays the number of the variable into the div line. 
When the loop starts back over, it will need to add another 1000 to the variable.

For the Beep Bop task, I will need a variable that starts at either 0 or 1.
I will need a loop that will write what iteration the loop is on and increase the variable by one.
When the variable can be divided by 3 the text will instead write "beep"
When the variable can be divided by 5 the text will instead write "bop"
When the variable can be divided by 3 and 5 the text will instead write "beepbop"

For the Runner Up task, I will need an array that lists the three best times of the day.
[00:00, 03:00, 21:00]
Will need to write code that displays the the second and third best times on two different divs.

For the Favorry task, I will need an array that lists my 5 favorite things.
Will need a loop that displays one item from that array with the text "is one of my favorite things."
Each item will need it's own div line.
