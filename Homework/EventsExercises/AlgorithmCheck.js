/*
For the Color Changer task, I will need to create three gray divs that are 200px by 200px and have 5px inbetween each other.
I will need on event listner that will be detecting when a div is clicked.
Depending on which div is clicked, it will change a different color. Red, green, blue respectfully.

For the Color Mixer task, I will need to create two divs and 9 buttons.
One div will start out black, but later display a color depending on what buttons are clicked.
The second div will display the current rgb values.
The 9 buttons will then be divided into three rows (Red, green, blue).
The three buttons in each row will show +1, +5, and +10.
Based on what button is clicked, the rgb values will change, which will end up changing both divs.

For the Flash Cards task, I will need three divs with a button in each.
Each button will hold a question.
When the button is clicked, the answer to the question will be displayed beside it in the div line.
Can only use one function.
