/*
The three tasks that I will do for this Homework are Make Divs, Check Win, and Check Win Function.

For the Make Divs task, I will need to copy over the array then make a loop that turns the contents of the array into a div line.
let objects = [blah]
for(i=0; i==objects.length;i++){
    creating the div
}

For the Check Win ask, I will need write lines of code that will take the value form the input field and turn it into an array. 
I will then need a loop that checks if there are three "1" in a row.
If so, it will display "Winner" if not then it will display "Not Winner"

For the Check Win Function, I wll need to do the same thing as the last task, but in the form of a funciton.
