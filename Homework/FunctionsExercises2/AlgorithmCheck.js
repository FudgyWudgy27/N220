/*
The first task that I will do will be the "Is Divisible by Seven" task.
In this task I will need to make an input that only accepts numbers, a button, and a div that will be used later on.
I'll then need a function that when ran (onclick for the button) will check if the another function is equal to a whole number.
The first function will divide the input value by 7.
The second function will display true or false in the div depending on whether or not the first funcion is divisble by 7.
function secondFunction(){
    Number.isInteger(firstFunction)
}


The second task that I will do will be the "Make Random" task.
In this task I will need a button and a div that will be used later on.
I will also need a function that generates a random whole number from 0-10 and another function that will call the generator function.
When the button is button is clicked, the second function will run, which in turn will call the other function and generate a random number.
The second function will then display that random number into the div line.

The third task that I will do will be the "Show Info" taks.
In this I will need three buttons and one dive line that will be used later.
I will also need an array containing three different strings.
I will need a function that when one of the buttons is clicked, it will have the value in the array that is associated with it displayed into the div line.
